\section{\texorpdfstring{New $\pi^0$ Kinematic Bins: $P_t$ vs $z$ bin}{New kinematic Bins: pt Vs z bin}}
\label{sec:newbins}
To better understand the kinematic dependence of the Collins fragmentation, a new mixed binning in $z$ and $P_t$ is introduced in this section. For each $P_t$ bin, 4 different $z$ bins are used. This binning explores the kinematic dependence of the Collins FF more completely, since it is expected that $H_1^{\bot}$ is dependent both on $z$ and $P_t$ and that this dependence does not factorize. Fig.~\ref{fig:ptznocorrection} is the $P_t$ vs. $z$ asymmetry without any correction. In Fig.~\ref{fig:ptzbkgcorrection} the background correction has been applied. As presented for the other binnings previously in sec.~\ref{sec:pi0bkgcorrection}, the background correction has only a small effect on the asymmetry. The thrust smearing correction is calculated the same way as in the previous section~\ref{sec:smearingcorrection}. Table~\ref{tab:16binsthrustfactor_compare} shows the smearing correction factor of the new kinematics bins and table~\ref{tab:zptcharmratio} shows the charm ratio. Notice that the fourth bin is empty because no hadron pair possesses lowest $z$ and highest $P_t$ simultaneously. Fig.~\ref{fig:ptzallcorrection} shows the result after background and thrust smearing corrections.

\caption{$\pi^0$ double ratio in $P_t$ vs. $z$ bins. The round points belong to the lowest $P_t$ bin, the red square points have $P_t$ range $0.15\sim 0.3$. The $P_t$ range for triangles is $0.3\sim 0.5$ and inverted triangles is $0.5\sim0.3$. Each group of 4 points belongs to one $z$ bin as indicated on the x-axis. The range for the z bins is $0.2<z_1<0.3$,  $0.3<z_1<0.5$, $0.5<z_1<0.7$ and $0.7<z_1<1$ from left to right. Notice that there are only 3 pink points, because in the highest $P_t$ range no hadron pairs fall in the $z$ range $0.1\sim 0.3$.}
