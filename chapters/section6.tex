\section{\texorpdfstring{Charge Pion Asymmetries and Comparison with Previous Analyses}{Comparison with Previous Analyses}}
\label{sec:comparewpreviouse}

The comparison between the $\pi^0$ double ratio and $\pi^{\pm}$ double ratio is of interest because charged pions and $\pi^0$ contain similar favored and disfavored Collins. In addition,there are measurements of $A^{UL}_{12}$ and $A^{UC}_{12}$, defined below, by BaBar~
\cite{BabarCharged} and Belle~\cite{ChargedPionResult2,ChargedPionResult}. Compared to the $\pi^0$ and $\eta$ asymmetries, the charged pion asymmetries $A^{UL}_{12}$ and $A^{UC}_{12}$ access a different combination of favored and disfavored fragmentation functions as shown in Eqs.~\eqref{eqn:allratiosexpress2}-\eqref{eqn:allratiosexpress3}. To do the comparison, the charged pions to thrust opening angle is limited to below 0.3, the same as the $\pi^0$ opening angle constraint.  The $A^{UL}_{12}$ and $A^{UC}_{12}$ double ratios for charged pions are given by: %in Eq.~\eqref{eqn:chargeddoubleratio1},.~\eqref{eqn:chargeddoubleratio2}. 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
A^{UL|}_{12}&=&\frac{A^U_{12}}{A^L_{12}}&=&\frac{\pi^+\pi^-}{\pi^+\pi^++\pi^-\pi^-}
\label{eqn:chargeddoubleratio1}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
A^{UC|}_{12}&=&\frac{A^U}{A^C}&=&\frac{\pi^+\pi^-}{\pi^+\pi^++\pi^-\pi^-+\pi^+\pi^-+\pi^-\pi^+}.
\label{eqn:chargeddoubleratio2}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}


The asymmetry $A_{12}^{\pi^0}$ can be expressed in terms of fragmentation functions as shown in eq.~(\ref{eqn:FF5}).%\cite{BabarCharged}\cite{ChargedPionResult2}
For the charged pion asymmetries $A^{UL}_{12}$ and $A^{UC}_{12}$ these relations can we written as

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
A^{UL}_{12}&=1+\cos(\phi_1+\phi_2)\frac{\sin^2(\theta)}{1+\cos^2(\theta)}\\
&\times\bigg\{\frac{5(H^{\bot,fav}_1H^{\bot,fav}_1+H^{\bot,dis}_1H^{\bot,dis}_1)+2H^{\bot,dis}_{1,s\rightarrow\pi}H^{\bot,dis}_{1,s\rightarrow\pi}}{5(D^{fav}_1D^{fav}_1+D^{dis}_1 D^{dis}_1)+2D^{dis}_{1,s\rightarrow\pi}D^{dis}_{1,s\rightarrow\pi}}\\
&-\frac{5H^{\bot,fav}_1 H^{\bot,dis}_1+H^{\bot,dis}_{1,s\rightarrow\pi}H^{\bot,dis}_{1,s\rightarrow\pi}}{5D^{fav}_1D^{dis}_1 +D^{dis}_{1,s\rightarrow\pi}D^{dis}_{1,s\rightarrow\pi}} \bigg\} 
\end{aligned}
\label{eqn:allratiosexpress2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
A^{UC}_{12}&=1+\cos(\phi_1+\phi_2)\frac{\sin^2(\theta)}{1+\cos^2(\theta)}\\
&\times\bigg\{\frac{5(H^{\bot,fav}_1H^{\bot,fav}_1+H^{\bot,dis}_1H^{\bot,dis}_1)+2H^{\bot,dis}_{1,s\rightarrow\pi}H^{\bot,dis}_{1,s\rightarrow\pi}}{5(D^{fav}_1D^{fav}_1+D^{dis}_1D^{dis}_1)+2D^{dis}_{1,s\rightarrow\pi}D^{dis}_{1,s\rightarrow\pi}}\\
&-\frac{5(H^{\bot,fav}_1+H^{\bot,dis}_1)(H^{\bot,dis}_1+H^{\bot,fav}_1)+4H^{\bot,dis}_{1,s\rightarrow\pi}H^{\bot,dis}_{1,s\rightarrow\pi}}{5(D^{\bot,fav}_1+D^{\bot,dis}_1)(D^{\bot,dis}_1+D^{\bot,fav}_1)+4D^{dis}_{1,s\rightarrow\pi}D^{dis}_{1,s\rightarrow\pi}} \bigg\}
\end{aligned}
\label{eqn:allratiosexpress3}
\end{equation}
Just like $\pi^0$, the thrust smearing effect has to be considered for charged pions. Here the same method has been used as described in section~\ref{sec:pi0thrustcorrection}. 
%The statistics are too low to have a reliable thrust correction factor for some bins, and those numbers are estimated based on the Belle Monte Carlo results. 
%Details about these estimations can be found in section~\ref{sec:appendix}. 
%For this comparison, we only apply the  thrust correction to the charged pion asymmetries.

Figure~\ref{fig:belleCompCharmCorr} shows the comparison with the previous Belle analysis. The agreement is in general good. The reduced $\chi^2$ value is 1.4 excluding the point in $(z_1,z_2)=(3,3)$, which is an outlier, otherwise 3.4.
Note that we corrected for the charm contribution by assuming that the asymmetry coming from charm is zero. Without this correction the reduced $\chi^2$ is 3.0. The results for the non-charm corrected comparison are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:belleComp}. The correction is necessary since the previous Belle results were corrected for the charm contribution.

Fig.~\ref{fig:pionCN} displays the comparison of UL, UC and $\pi^0$ double ratios. In the figure it can be seen that the $\pi^0$ double ratio asymmetry is lower than the UL double ratio, and it is close to the UC ratios. After correcting for the thrust smearing effect, in Fig.~\ref{fig:pionCNcorrection}, the last $(z_1,z_2)$ bins result for charged pion is around 0.25 with large error bar.

%In \cite{BabarCharged}, the Collins asymmetry for charged pions is measured using a data sample collected by the  BaBar collaboration.
%However there are some crucial differences between the work presented in this note and the BaBar results. Most importantly, the BaBar results are corrected with respect to the $q\bar{q}$ axis obtained from leading order MC. They also apply charm and mis-PID corrections. Furthermore, the binning used is different. However, it is worth to note that for the z bin that are the same, our results are consistent and the shape of the asymmetries in $z$, $P_t$ also seem to be consistent.
%studies, mis-PID correction and charm contribution are not considered and the thrust smearing correction factors are applied on the corresponding bins while the other two researches use a average correction factor. Also the smearing correciton factor was calculated using real $q\bar{q}$ axis in previous studies while here we use stable thrust axis. 

%And tighter fiducial constraint applied may increase the statistical uncertainties as well as the Collins asymmetry. Different kinematic bins are assigned and only the bin with $0.5<z_1<0.7, 0.5<z_2<0.7$ is the same with $(z_1,z_2)$ bins 7 in this note. The comparison is listed in Table~\ref{tab:compare}. There are many possible reasons for the difference between measurement. In this note mis-PID correction and charm contribution are not considered and the thrust smearing correction factors are applied on the corresponding bins while the other two researches use a average correction factor. Also tighter fiducial constraint may increase the statistical uncertainties as well as the Collins asymmetry.
